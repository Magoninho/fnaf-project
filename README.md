# Five Night's at Freddy's Clone with TypeScript

I think this is a nice little project to put on my portfolio.

## [Play it](https://fivenightsatfreddys.netlify.app) (it's not a "game" yet but ok)

## Todo

- [x] add more cameras
- [ ] add doors, lights, stuff that is not camera related lol
- [ ] add freddy movement
- [ ] document the code (looks awful)

All rigths belong to Scott Cawthon, creator of Five Nights at Freddy's  
(buy the original game, this one is nothing compared to the original one)
